#  LockWatch

Display watch faces on your iOS Lock Screen – inspired by Apple Watch

## Description

LockWatch is back (again) – this time even for unjailbroken users!

LockWatch brings an almost perfect recreation of most of the watch faces included in watchOS 4 – right to your iOS LockScreen.
Today's christmas release is bringing you the LockWatch Demo App, an app that shows the capabilities of LockWatch without requiring a jailbreak, and an almost completed tweak for jailbroken users.

Both the tweak and the demo app are compatible with iOS 10 and iOS 11 on both iPhone and iPad, with iOS 9 support following early 2018.

## Usage

LockWatch works just like Apple Watch: Force touch a watch face to enter selection mode, swipe through all available watch faces and select the one you like, or customize it the way you want. On devices that do not feature 3D Touch, you can long press to enter selection mode.

When using the tweak, press the home button to leave selection or editing mode. The demo app provides a button to emulate the home button in these cases.

To install the demo app on an unjailbroken device, head over to the Releases section, download the latest .ipa and use Cydia Impactor to install the app to your device.
